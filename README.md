# Finance Tracker

This is a razor pages practice project modeled after my real expenses Google spreadsheet.

### Fixed expense

A **fixed expense** is a monthly expense that mostly stays the same each month. For example, subscriptions, rent, car payments, etc.

There can be some variation in the price, like house/apartment utilities, grocery bills, etc.

### Budget

The **budget** is the following:

- Cash In = net monthly cash from paychecks
- Cash Out = how money is taken out per month for fixed expenses
- Disposable Income = how much money is left to spend after fixed expenses are taken out

### Purchases

This one is self explanatory. Lets you keep record of your purchases.

### Balance

The first purchase recorded is subtracted from the Disposable Income. From then on, each subsequent purchase is subtracted from the previous
purchase's balance. The goal is to **NOT** let balance grow to zero (cause that would obviously mean you're bank account isn't growing)
